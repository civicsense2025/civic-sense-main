# CivicSense Brand Voice & Content Rules

*Reference: `docs/branding-content.md` - Always check this guide before writing any content*

## Core Voice Principles

### Write Like Tán Talking to a Smart Friend
- **Natural, not forced**: Avoid overusing "civic" in every sentence - talk about "understanding power" or "democratic participation" instead
- **Direct personal communication**: Every email, UI text, and content piece should feel like it's coming directly from Tán, not from a corporation
- **Story-driven**: Lead with narrative, not facts. Connect to personal experience before explaining concepts
- **Specific about power**: Name actual people, institutions, and mechanisms rather than vague "government" references

### Content Requirements

**EVERY piece of content must:**
1. Answer "why should I care?" in the first paragraph
2. Include specific next steps the user can take
3. Connect abstract concepts to concrete personal consequences
4. Challenge assumptions while providing evidence
5. Feel authentic and conversational, not corporate or academic

### Email Communication Standards
- **Subject lines**: Natural language that sparks curiosity, not marketing-speak
- **Opening**: Start with story or personal insight, not summary
- **Body**: One key insight per email with verifiable examples
- **Closing**: Personal sign-off from Tán acknowledging their work

### Language Guidelines

**AVOID overusing "civic":**
- ❌ "civic education", "civic engagement", "civic learning" in every sentence
- ✅ "understanding how power works", "democratic participation", "government literacy"

**BE specific about power:**
- ❌ "Government officials decided"
- ✅ "Republican senators voted to..." or "The Biden administration chose to..."

**CONNECT to personal impact:**
- ❌ "This policy affects the economy"
- ✅ "This policy determines whether your rent goes up next year"

### Success Metrics
We succeed when people become:
- Harder to manipulate
- More difficult to ignore
- Impossible to fool

Every interaction should build confidence to engage with power structures, not just complain about them.
