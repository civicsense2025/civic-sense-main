```

## Red Flags (Automatic Rejection)

### Content that MUST be rejected:
- **False Equivalencies**: "Both sides" language that obscures responsibility
- **Passive Voice Dominance**: Consistently avoids naming specific actors
- **Vague Action Steps**: "Citizens should get involved" without specifics
- **Diplomatic Softening**: "Some experts suggest" instead of "Research proves"
- **Entertainment Framing**: Treats politics like sports or entertainment
- **Assumption Reinforcement**: Supports narratives that keep people passive
- **No Uncomfortable Truths**: Stays within comfortable conventional wisdom

### Warning Signs (Needs Improvement):
- Lack of specific dollar amounts, dates, or names
- Missing connection between individual and systemic action
- Insufficient source verification
- No clear "what politicians don't want you to know" element
- Action steps that lack strategic thinking
- Analysis that doesn't reveal hidden power dynamics

## Quality Enhancement Prompts

### For Increasing Boldness
- "What's the most uncomfortable truth about this topic that politicians don't want people to understand?"
- "Who specifically benefits from people not knowing this information?"
- "What assumption does this challenge that keeps people passive?"
- "How can we make this more direct and uncompromising?"

### For Power Dynamics Clarity
- "Who actually makes this decision vs. who appears to?"
- "Where does the money flow and who benefits financially?"
- "What's the gap between official process and actual process?"
- "Which institutions have real power vs. apparent power?"

### For Action Enhancement
- "What specific action can someone take in the next 24 hours?"
- "What exact words should they say when contacting officials?"
- "How does this individual action connect to broader change?"
- "What strategic advantage does this action provide?"

## Success Metrics

### Content Performance Indicators
- **Civic Actions Taken**: Number of users who report taking action after consuming content
- **Official Contacts Made**: Verifiable contacts with representatives/institutions
- **Misconceptions Corrected**: Pre/post assessment improvements
- **Strategic Thinking Development**: User ability to identify power dynamics independently
- **Political Efficacy Increase**: User confidence in ability to create change

### Brand Impact Metrics
- **Politician Discomfort Index**: Do elected officials respond to or try to counter our content?
- **Narrative Challenge Success**: Do mainstream outlets pick up our framing?
- **Assumption Disruption Rate**: Do users report changed understanding of power?
- **Activation Conversion**: Percentage of passive learners who become active citizens

## The Bottom Line

**Every piece of content must advance our mission of transforming passive observers into confident, effective participants in democracy.**

### Content succeeds when:
- Politicians would prefer people not know this information
- Readers feel uncomfortable but empowered
- Conventional wisdom is challenged with evidence
- Specific actions lead to measurable civic engagement
- Users become harder to manipulate and impossible to fool

### Content fails when:
- It reinforces existing power structures
- Readers feel good but take no action
- It maintains comfortable assumptions
- Action steps are vague or ineffective
- Users remain passive consumers

**Remember: We're not building content to make people feel good about American government. We're building content to give them the tools to actually understand and change it.**

*This rubric ensures every piece of content lives up to our promise: civic education that politicians don't want you to have.*
