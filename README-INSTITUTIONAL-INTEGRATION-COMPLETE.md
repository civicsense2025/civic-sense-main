## 5  Single Sign‑On (SSO) Implementation

### 5.1  Why SSO over stand‑alone logins?

* **One password** for every district app → fewer reset tickets.
* Central place to turn off departing staff accounts.
* Lets districts apply MFA, geo‑blocks, and conditional access centrally.

### 5.2  Supported Providers

| Provider                       | Protocol                  | Typical District Usage                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Google Workspace for Education | OpenID Connect            | Most Chromebooks & Google Classroom schools |
| Microsoft Entra ID             | SAML 2.0 or OIDC          | Windows & O365 districts                    |
| Clever SSO                     | OAuth 2.0 (+ roster sync) | Common in K‑12 app marketplace              |

> **Tip**  Offer at least Google & Microsoft; add Clever for App Gallery listing.

### 5.3  Flow (Google OIDC example)

1. **Front‑end:** `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google', options: { scopes: 'openid email profile' } })`
2. **Google:** prompts user → returns `id_token` + `access_token` to your redirect URI.
3. **Supabase Auth:** validates token, upserts user in `auth.users`, issues a JWT with custom claims: `school_id`, `role`.
4. **Client:** stores session in secure, SameSite = Strict cookie.

### 5.4  Session & Token Security

* Rotate refresh tokens every 24 h.
* Revoke token immediately if SSO provider sends a *user disabled* webhook.
* Short (10 min) auth‐code lifetime to block replay.

---

## 6  Role‑Based Access with Row Level Security (RLS)

### 6.1  Schema Snippet

```sql
-- Schools (tenants)
create table schools (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null
);

-- Users (already in auth.users)
create table profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade,
  school_id uuid references schools(id),
  role text check (role in ('district_admin','teacher','student')),
  primary key(id)
);

-- Learning pods
create table pods (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  school_id uuid references schools(id),
  name text
);

create table pod_members (
  pod_id uuid references pods(id),
  user_id uuid references profiles(id),
  role text check (role in ('mentor','member')),
  primary key (pod_id, user_id)
);
```

### 6.2  Core RLS Policies

```sql
-- 1  Tenant isolation
create policy "School isolation" on all tables
  using ( school_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'school_id' );

-- 2  Students read only their own PII
create policy "Students can read self" on profiles
for select using (
  role = 'student' and id = auth.uid()
);

-- 3  Teachers manage their pods
create policy "Teachers manage pod members" on pod_members
  for all using (
    exists (
      select 1 from profiles p
      where p.id = auth.uid()
        and p.role = 'teacher'
        and p.school_id = pod_members.school_id
    )
);
```

Enable RLS (`alter table … enable row level security;`) on **every** user‑facing table.

## 7  Feature Controls & Live‑Chat Restrictions

| Feature                                 | Default State                       | How to Toggle                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live chat (Realtime channel `pod_{id}`) | **Off** for students                | Feature flag table `feature_flags(school_id, feature, enabled)` plus RLS check. |
| File uploads                            | Teachers only                       | Policy: role = 'teacher' on `storage.objects`.                                  |
| AI‑generated hints                      | Opt‑in per district (COPPA concern) | Config JSON in `schools.settings`.                                              |

*Explain clearly to districts which features can be disabled to meet local policy.*

---

## 8  Third‑Party Integrations

### 8.1  Clever Secure Sync & SSO

1. **Register** app → get Client ID/Secret.
2. **Scopes:** `read:students`, `read:teachers`, `read:sections` (minimum).
3. **Webhook** endpoint `/api/clever/roster` upserts data to `schools`, `profiles`, `pods`.
4. **SSO** uses standard OAuth PKCE; validate `iss`, `aud`, `sub` claims.

### 8.2  Google Classroom Sync

* Scopes: `classroom.courses.readonly`, `classroom.rosters.readonly` only.
* Nightly Edge Function pulls active courses; maps them to pods.
* Auto‑disable if teacher revokes access token.
