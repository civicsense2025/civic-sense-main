# Quiz Navigation System

A comprehensive navigation system for CivicSense quizzes that reduces friction and improves user experience by allowing seamless navigation between quizzes without returning to the homepage.

## üöÄ Features

### Visual Navigation
- **Preview Cards**: Show adjacent quizzes with title, emoji, date, and metadata
- **Smart Positioning**: Navigation elements positioned at viewport edges (left/right center)
- **Topic Information**: Display question count, reading time, and special badges (Breaking, Featured)
- **Accessibility Indicators**: Clear visual cues for quizzes without questions

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Arrow Keys**: `‚Üê` / `‚Üí` for previous/next navigation
- **Vim-style**: `H` / `L` for previous/next (power users)
- **Home Navigation**: `Esc` to return to homepage
- **Smart Context**: Shortcuts disabled when typing in forms

### Navigation Logic
**Consistent with Homepage**: Both the homepage daily-card-stack and quiz navigation use the same reverse chronological ordering (newest topics first).

- **Left arrow (‚Üê)** = Previous in list = **Newer topic** (earlier in reverse chronological order)
- **Right arrow (‚Üí)** = Next in list = **Older topic** (later in reverse chronological order)

This creates a consistent experience where users navigate through topics in the same logical order whether they're on the homepage or in a quiz.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### API Endpoint
- **Route**: `/api/topics/navigation`
- **Method**: GET/POST
- **Parameters**: `topicId` (required), `limit` (optional, default: 3)
- **Ordering**: Matches daily-card-stack reverse chronological order

### Components
1. **QuizNavigation** (`components/quiz/quiz-navigation.tsx`)
   - Main navigation component with keyboard shortcuts
   - Tooltip hints and accessibility features
   - Responsive design with compact mode

2. **useQuizNavigation** (`hooks/useQuizNavigation.ts`)
   - Custom hook for navigation state management
   - Keyboard event handling
   - Data fetching and caching

### Integration Points
- **Quiz Pages**: Integrated into `app/quiz/[topicId]/client.tsx`
- **Topic Info**: Shows in both quiz mode and topic info mode
- **Homepage**: Consistent with daily-card-stack navigation pattern

## üéØ User Experience

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
1. User loads quiz page
2. useQuizNavigation hook fetches adjacent topics
3. Navigation API returns previous/next topics in correct order
4. Component renders with keyboard shortcuts enabled
5. User navigates ‚Üí new topic loads seamlessly
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Navigation**: Prevents rapid-fire requests
- **Smart Caching**: Reuses data when possible
- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads when navigation is available
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful degradation on failures

### State Management
```typescript
interface NavigationState {
  previousTopic: NavigationTopic | null
  nextTopic: NavigationTopic | null
  hasPrevious: boolean
  hasNext: boolean
  isLoading: boolean
  error: string | null
}
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements
