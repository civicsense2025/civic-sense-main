This legal protection is designed to shield monetary policy from political interference. However, in 2018, President Trump publicly criticized Powell over interest rate hikes, raising concerns about potential overreach. The Federal Reserve's independence is critical to maintaining economic stability, as outlined in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (12 U.S.C. ยง 242).",
