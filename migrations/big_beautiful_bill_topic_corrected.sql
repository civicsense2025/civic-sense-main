    'How Republicans Are Disguising the Largest Healthcare Cuts in History as "Tax Relief"',
    'House Republicans passed Trump''s "One Big Beautiful Bill" by a single vote after midnight negotiations, claiming it provides "tax relief for working families." But the 1,000+ page bill actually cuts $880 billion from Medicaid while permanently extending tax cuts that give 82% of benefits to the top 5% of earners, and the Congressional Budget Office confirms it adds $3 trillion to the deficit despite Republican claims of fiscal responsibility.',
    '<ul>
        <li><strong>They''re calling healthcare cuts "deficit reduction":</strong> Republicans claim the bill saves money by cutting $880 billion from Medicaid over 10 years, but they''re simultaneously adding $3.8 trillion in tax cuts for the wealthyâ€”meaning they''re taking healthcare from 10.3 million Americans to fund billionaire tax breaks</li>
        <li><strong>They''re hiding the Medicaid work requirements behind "anti-fraud" language:</strong> The bill imposes 80-hour monthly work requirements for childless adults while calling it "eliminating waste, fraud and abuse"â€”but 74% of non-disabled Medicaid recipients already work, revealing this as deliberate coverage elimination</li>
        <li><strong>They''re using budget gimmicks to hide the true cost:</strong> Republicans set many provisions to expire artificially to manipulate the 10-year cost estimate, but everyone knows they''ll extend them laterâ€”if made permanent, the bill actually costs $5 trillion, not the $3 trillion they''re admitting</li>
        <li><strong>They''re ignoring massive public opposition:</strong> Multiple polls show 64% disapproval and only 35% support, but Mitch McConnell told fellow Republicans that worried Americans will "get over it" while they ram through legislation serving wealthy donors over voters</li>
        <li><strong>They''re gambling with rural hospital systems:</strong> The bill cuts Medicaid funding that keeps 1,800+ rural hospitals operating, but Republicans are betting rural voters won''t blame them when emergency rooms close because the cuts won''t hit until after the 2026 elections</li>
        <li><strong>They''re weaponizing the debt ceiling to force passage:</strong> Trump demands Congress raise the debt limit by $4 trillion as part of this bill, essentially holding the global economy hostage to force through legislation that benefits his wealthy supporters while cutting services for working families</li>
