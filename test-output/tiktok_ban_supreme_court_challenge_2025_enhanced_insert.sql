    'If upheld, the decision could establish precedent allowing government to ban foreign-owned digital platforms based on national security concerns, potentially expanding executive and legislative power over internet communications. This might enable future restrictions on other foreign apps, social media platforms, or digital services. However, it could also establish limits requiring compelling security justifications and narrow tailoring, depending on the Court''s reasoning.',
    'Consider both how this decision might expand government power and what limits the Court might establish.',
    'A Supreme Court decision upholding the TikTok ban could significantly expand government authority to regulate digital communications based on national security concerns, potentially affecting future cases involving foreign-owned platforms, data privacy, and online speech. However, the Court''s specific reasoning will determine whether this creates broad government power or establishes careful limits that protect constitutional rights. Citizens must understand these implications because they will shape the future of digital rights and democratic discourse in America.',
