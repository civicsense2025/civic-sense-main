# Multiplayer Room System Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. localStorage Error (ReferenceError: localStorage is not defined)

**Problem**: The `getOrCreateGuestToken` function in `hooks/useGuestAccess.ts` was directly accessing `localStorage` without checking if it was running in a browser environment, causing SSR (Server-Side Rendering) errors.

**Root Cause**: 
- Line 518 in `getOrCreateGuestToken` function was calling `localStorage.getItem()` directly
- `clearGuestToken` function was also accessing `localStorage` directly
- These functions can be called during server-side rendering where `localStorage` is not available

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Enhanced `safeLocalStorage` helper**: Added `removeItem` method to the existing helper that already had browser environment checks:
   ```typescript
   removeItem: (key: string): boolean => {
     if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false
     try {
       localStorage.removeItem(key)
       return true
     } catch (error) {
       console.error(`Error accessing localStorage.removeItem for key "${key}":`, error)
       return false
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Updated `getOrCreateGuestToken` function**:
   - Added browser environment check: `if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null`
   - Replaced direct `localStorage` calls with `safeLocalStorage` helper
   - Function now safely returns `null` during SSR instead of throwing errors

3. **Updated `clearGuestToken` function**:
   - Replaced direct `localStorage.removeItem()` with `safeLocalStorage.removeItem()`
   - Removed redundant browser check since `safeLocalStorage` already handles it

**Files Modified**:
- `hooks/useGuestAccess.ts` (lines 38-55, 518-529, 536-540)

### 2. API Cleanup Error (cleanupExpiredRooms is not a function)

**Problem**: The `/api/multiplayer/cleanup` endpoint was failing with `TypeError: multiplayerOperations.cleanupExpiredRooms is not a function`.

**Root Cause**: 
- Potential build cache issues after previous changes
- Next.js build cache may have been referencing old module exports

**Fix Applied**:
1. **Cleared Next.js build cache**: Removed `.next` directory to force fresh build
2. **Verified export structure**: Confirmed `multiplayerOperations` object correctly exports `cleanupExpiredRooms` function in `lib/multiplayer.ts`
3. **Function exists and is properly exported**: The function is correctly defined at line 339 and exported as part of the `multiplayerOperations` object at line 101

**Files Verified**:
- `lib/multiplayer.ts` (export structure confirmed)
- `app/api/multiplayer/cleanup/route.ts` (import structure confirmed)

### 3. Room Navigation Issues

**Problem**: Users could see their rooms in the lobby but clicking into rooms would fail to load properly.

**Analysis**: 
- The room navigation logic in the lobby component is correct
- The multiplayer quiz client has proper error handling and loading states
- The `useMultiplayerRoom` hook has comprehensive logging and error handling
- Room navigation URLs are properly formatted: `/quiz/${topicId}/multiplayer?room=${roomCode}&player=${playerId}`

**Status**: The room navigation code appears to be correctly implemented. Any remaining issues may be related to:
1. Database connectivity
2. Room expiration (rooms may be cleaned up before navigation)
3. Player authentication state mismatches

## Testing

### Created Test Pages

1. **`/test-localStorage-fix`**: Tests the localStorage fix and SSR safety
2. **`/test-room-management`**: Tests room cleanup and user room loading (already existed)

### Verification Steps

1. **localStorage Fix**:
   - Visit `/test-localStorage-fix` 
   - Test should show no errors in both SSR and client-side environments
   - Guest token generation should work without throwing localStorage errors

2. **API Cleanup**:
   - Visit `/test-room-management`
   - Click "Test API Cleanup" - should succeed without "function not found" errors
   - Click "Test Direct Cleanup" - should also succeed

3. **Room Navigation**:
   - Create a room in `/multiplayer` lobby
   - Room should appear in "Your Rooms" section
   - Clicking on the room should navigate to the waiting room successfully

## Technical Details

### Safe localStorage Pattern
The fix implements a defensive programming pattern for localStorage access:

```typescript
const safeLocalStorage = {
  getItem: (key: string): string | null => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') return null
    try {
      return localStorage.getItem(key)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Error accessing localStorage.getItem for key "${key}":`, error)
      return null
    }
  },
  // ... similar pattern for setItem and removeItem
}
```

This pattern:
- Checks for browser environment before accessing localStorage
- Gracefully handles localStorage access errors (quota exceeded, private browsing, etc.)
- Provides consistent fallback behavior
- Prevents SSR hydration mismatches

### Build Cache Management
- Clearing `.next` directory resolves module resolution issues
- Important to clear cache after making changes to core library files
- Next.js sometimes caches module exports aggressively

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Room Expiration**: Rooms expire after 24 hours (authenticated) or 1 hour (guest). Users may see rooms that expire between loading the lobby and clicking to join.

2. **Real-time Updates**: The lobby refreshes every 30 seconds. If a room expires or changes status between refreshes, users might encounter navigation issues.

3. **Error Handling**: The multiplayer system has comprehensive error handling, but network issues or database connectivity problems could still cause navigation failures.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use safe localStorage patterns** in any client-side code that might run during SSR
2. **Clear Next.js cache** when making changes to core library files
3. **Test both SSR and client-side rendering** for any browser API usage
4. **Use TypeScript strict mode** to catch potential undefined access patterns
