        "question": "Explain why Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination for Attorney General and how this demonstrates the Senate's constitutional role.",
        "correctAnswer": "Gaetz withdrew because he lacked sufficient Republican support in the Senate due to ethics investigations involving sexual misconduct allegations. This shows the Senate's advice and consent role working as intended - even senators from the president's party can reject nominees they find unqualified or problematic.",
        "hint": "Think about the ethics investigations and the lack of Republican Senate support that led to his withdrawal.",
        "explanation": "This situation proves that the confirmation process can work to protect citizens from potentially unfit appointees. When you vote for senators, you're choosing people who have the constitutional duty to thoroughly vet nominees, regardless of party loyalty, to ensure only qualified individuals serve in positions that affect your daily life.",

        "question": "Analyze how Trump's demand for recess appointments reflects the tension between executive efficiency and legislative oversight in the American system of government.",
        "correctAnswer": "Trump argues recess appointments are needed for efficiency because Senate confirmations can take months or years, delaying his ability to implement his agenda. However, this bypasses the Senate's constitutional role of advice and consent, which serves as a crucial check on executive power to ensure only qualified nominees serve in key positions.",
        "hint": "Consider the balance between a president's need to fill positions quickly and the Senate's duty to review nominees carefully.",
        "explanation": "This tension is exactly what the founders intended - they wanted government to be effective but not so powerful that it could ignore other branches. Your participation in elections for both president and senators helps maintain this balance, ensuring government works efficiently while protecting your interests through proper oversight.",
