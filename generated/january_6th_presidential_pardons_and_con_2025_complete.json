        "correctAnswer": "Citizens can: 1) Contact elected representatives to express views and advocate for policy positions, ensuring lawmakers understand constituent concerns; 2) Vote in elections for candidates whose values align with their views on accountability and justice. These actions matter because they maintain democratic accountability even when specific decisions cannot be reversed, and they help shape future leadership and policies that reflect citizen values.",

        "correctAnswer": "The current framework provides necessary executive flexibility for mercy and national healing but may lack sufficient accountability mechanisms for controversial mass pardons. The January 6th case demonstrates both the power's potential benefits (ending divisive prosecutions) and risks (undermining rule of law). Potential reforms might include waiting periods, congressional review for mass pardons, or transparency requirements, though any changes must preserve the pardon power's essential function while ensuring it serves democratic rather than purely political purposes.",
        "hint": "Consider both the benefits of unreviewable pardon power and the democratic concerns it raises.",
        "explanation": "This analysis requires citizens to weigh competing democratic values: executive flexibility versus accountability, mercy versus justice, and healing versus consequences. Understanding these tensions helps citizens evaluate whether current institutions adequately serve democratic purposes and what reforms might strengthen both effective governance and democratic accountability.",

The January 6th case demonstrates both the power's potential benefits (ending divisive prosecutions) and risks (undermining rule of law). Potential reforms might include waiting periods, congressional review for mass pardons, or transparency requirements, though any changes must preserve the pardon power's essential function while ensuring it serves democratic rather than purely political purposes.",
