    "description": "These proposals respond to declining public confidence in the Supreme Court following ethics scandals and controversial decisions. Understanding these reforms helps citizens evaluate how democratic institutions can be strengthened and what role they play in holding government accountable.",

        "question": "Analyze how declining public confidence in the Supreme Court (from 66% approval in 2020 to 61% disapproval in 2024) affects the Court's democratic legitimacy and the broader health of American democracy.",
        "correctAnswer": "When most citizens lose trust in the Supreme Court, it undermines the Court's ability to make decisions that people will respect and follow voluntarily. This erosion of legitimacy weakens the rule of law and can lead to increased political polarization, as people view Court decisions as partisan rather than based on legal principles. It threatens democratic stability when a co-equal branch of government loses public confidence.",
        "hint": "Think about why public trust matters for institutions that don't face elections but still need citizen compliance with their decisions.",
        "explanation": "Understanding institutional legitimacy helps you see why ethics and transparency matter beyond just preventing corruption. When you lose faith in democratic institutions, it becomes harder for the system to function effectively and maintain social cohesion.",
