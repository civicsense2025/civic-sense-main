        "question": "Explain how this case demonstrates the importance of voting in both federal and state elections for protecting citizen interests.",
        "correctAnswer": "This case shows that voting matters at multiple levels: federal elections determine who appoints judges that can check presidential power, congressional elections choose representatives who control spending decisions, and state elections select attorneys general who can challenge federal overreach. The 22 state attorneys general who sued were elected officials representing their citizens' interests against federal actions that could harm local services. Citizens who vote in all elections help ensure they have advocates at every level of government.",

        "question": "Analyze what this case reveals about the balance between presidential power and congressional authority, and why this balance matters for ordinary citizens.",
        "correctAnswer": "This case reveals that the Constitution creates a careful balance where Congress controls spending decisions and the president executes them, but cannot unilaterally change them. The Impoundment Control Act reinforces this balance by requiring presidential requests to Congress before withholding funds. This matters for citizens because it prevents any one person from suddenly cutting programs people depend on - from school funding to disaster relief. The judicial intervention shows how courts protect this balance, ensuring that major spending decisions go through the democratic process where citizens can influence their representatives rather than being made by executive decree.",
        "hint": "Consider why the founders separated these powers and what happens when that separation breaks down.",
        "explanation": "This balance protects you from having essential services suddenly cut by presidential whim. It ensures that major changes to government programs go through a democratic process where you can influence the outcome through your representatives, rather than being decided by one person in the White House.",
