    title: "Learning Pods for Families & Classrooms",
    story: "I kept getting emails from parents asking if their kids could use CivicSense together, and from teachers wanting to use it in class. The problem was that civic education works best when you can discuss it with others‚Äîdemocracy isn't a solo activity. So I built learning pods where families and classrooms can learn together in private groups with proper oversight. It took way longer than expected because building collaborative features is hard, but watching families have real conversations about how government works has been incredible.",
    impact: "Families are finally having those dinner table conversations about civics that we've all been missing. Teachers are using it for government classes, and parents can guide their kids through complex political topics.",

    title: "Better Surveys That Actually Matter",
    story: "The original surveys felt like homework‚Äîboring questions that didn't connect to real life. I rewrote everything to focus on what actually matters: understanding where people are in their civic journey and giving them concrete next steps. Instead of asking abstract questions, we now ask things like 'When was the last time you contacted your representative?' and follow up with specific actions you can take this week.",
    impact: "People are getting personalized recommendations that lead to real civic action, not just more knowledge they don't use.",
    emoji: "üìã"
  },
  {
    date: "June 17, 2025",
    category: "improvement", 
    title: "Mobile-First Everything",
    story: "I realized most people were trying to use CivicSense on their phones during commutes or lunch breaks, but the experience was clunky. I rebuilt the entire interface mobile-first and added voice features so you can listen to explanations while walking. The swipe gestures for quiz answers feel natural now, and the text sizes actually work on small screens.",
    impact: "Civic learning now fits into your actual life instead of requiring you to sit at a computer.",
    emoji: "üì±"
  },
  {
    date: "June 16-17, 2025",
    category: "fix",
    title: "Removed Barriers for Guest Users",
    story: "I was creating too many hoops for people to jump through before they could start learning. The whole point is to make civic education accessible, but I was asking for accounts and payments before people even knew if they wanted to use it. I simplified everything so anyone can start learning immediately, and added special access for students and teachers because civic education should be free for those who need it most.",
    impact: "Way more people are actually starting their civic learning journey instead of bouncing off the landing page.",
    emoji: "üö™"

    date: "June 12, 2025",
    category: "feature",
    title: "CivicSense Platform Launch",
    story: "After months of building in private, I finally launched CivicSense publicly. The goal was simple: create civic education that actually works‚Äîthat teaches people how power really operates instead of just reciting textbook facts. I focused on uncomfortable truths about how government actually functions and connected everything to real actions people can take. It's the civic education I wish I'd had.",
    impact: "People are learning about civics in a way that actually prepares them for real democratic participation.",
