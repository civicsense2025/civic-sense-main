# AI Content Generation from News Articles

CivicSense now includes a comprehensive AI-powered workflow that automatically generates civic education content from news articles stored in your database.

## Overview

This system:
1. **Pulls news articles** from your `source_metadata` table 
2. **Filters for civic relevance** using keyword matching and credibility scores
3. **Compares against existing content** to avoid duplicates
4. **Generates new topics and questions** using GPT-4o
5. **Saves to database** with review status for admin approval

## How It Works

### 1. News Article Collection
- News articles are automatically saved to `source_metadata` via the News Ticker API
- Articles include metadata like credibility scores, bias ratings, and source information
- Only articles with credibility scores â‰¥70% are considered for content generation

### 2. Content Generation Process
The AI system follows CivicSense's brand principles:
- **Truth over comfort**: Present facts that challenge popular narratives
- **Clarity over politeness**: Cut through political doublespeak
- **Action over consumption**: Connect learning to civic participation
- **Systems thinking**: Address root causes, not just symptoms

### 3. Duplicate Prevention
- Compares article titles and content against existing topics
- Uses keyword overlap analysis (>60% overlap = duplicate)
- Can be overridden with "Force Generation" option

### 4. Quality Standards
Generated content follows strict guidelines:
- 8th-10th grade reading level
- Specific names, dates, and concrete details
- Connection to democratic participation
- Mix of question types and difficulty levels
- Verified sources with real URLs

## API Endpoint

### `/api/admin/generate-content-from-news`

**POST Request:**
```json

## Monitoring and Quality Control

### Success Metrics
- Articles processed vs. content generated ratio
- Duplicate detection accuracy
- Admin approval rates
- User engagement with generated content

### Error Handling
- Failed articles are logged with specific error messages
- Partial failures don't stop the entire process
- Rate limiting prevents API overuse
- Graceful fallbacks for invalid content

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. **Start small**: Begin with 5-10 articles to test quality
2. **Review carefully**: Generated content needs human oversight
3. **Monitor sources**: Ensure diverse, credible news sources
4. **Update regularly**: Run generation weekly for fresh content

### For Content Quality
1. **Verify sources**: Check that generated URLs are real and accessible
2. **Test questions**: Ensure questions are answerable and educational
3. **Review explanations**: Confirm they connect to civic participation
4. **Check for bias**: Maintain non-partisan educational focus

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No articles found**: Check if news ticker is collecting articles
- **Generation fails**: Verify OpenAI API key and credentials
- **Poor quality content**: Review prompt engineering and filtering
- **Duplicate detection**: Adjust overlap threshold if needed

### Technical Support
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify database permissions for content insertion
- Test API endpoints individually for debugging
- Monitor OpenAI usage and rate limits

## Automated Scheduling System

### Schedule Management
The system includes a comprehensive scheduling system for automated content generation:

#### API Endpoint: `/api/admin/schedule-content-generation`
- **GET**: List all scheduled generation configs
- **POST**: Create, update, delete, or run scheduled generations
- **PUT**: CRON endpoint for automated execution (requires `CRON_SECRET`)

#### Scheduling Features
- **Multiple Intervals**: Every 12 hours, daily, or weekly
- **Time Control**: Specify exact time of day for generation
- **Future Dating**: Generate content for days ahead (returning to quiz-per-day model)
- **Individual Management**: Each user manages their own schedules
- **Manual Triggers**: Run scheduled jobs immediately for testing

#### Setting Up Automated Generation

1. **Configure Generation Settings** in the admin interface
2. **Enable "Generate for Future Dates"**
3. **Set start date and duration** (e.g., 7 days ahead)
4. **Click "Save as Scheduled Job"** (coming soon in UI)
5. **Set up cron job** to call the scheduling endpoint

#### CRON Setup Example
```bash
# Run every 12 hours at 6 AM and 6 PM
0 6,18 * * * curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}" \
  https://yoursite.com/api/admin/schedule-content-generation
```

#### Environment Variables Required
- `CRON_SECRET`: Secret token for secure cron job execution
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Your site URL for internal API calls

### Returning to Quiz-Per-Day Model

The scheduling system enables you to return to a consistent quiz-per-day model:

1. **Set up daily generation** with `daysAhead: 1` 
2. **Schedule for early morning** (e.g., 6 AM)
3. **Generate content for the next day** automatically
4. **Ensure consistent daily content** without manual intervention

#### Example Daily Schedule Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "Daily Quiz Generation",
  "schedule": {
    "interval": "daily",
    "timeOfDay": "06:00",
    "timezone": "America/New_York"
  },
  "generationSettings": {
    "maxArticles": 5,
    "daysSinceCreated": 1,
    "questionsPerTopic": 6,
    "daysAhead": 1,
    "questionTypeDistribution": {
      "multipleChoice": 70,
      "trueFalse": 20,
      "shortAnswer": 10
    }
  }
}
```

This ensures that every morning at 6 AM, the system:
- Pulls the latest news from yesterday
- Generates 6-question quizzes for tomorrow
- Maintains a pipeline of ready-to-publish content

## Future Enhancements

- **Full Scheduling UI**: Complete interface for schedule management
- **Category-specific generation**: Focus on specific civic areas
- **Multi-language content generation**: International civic education
- **Automated quality scoring**: AI-powered content validation
