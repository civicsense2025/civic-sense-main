# CivicSense Scheduled Content Generation System

*Complete automation for civic education content creation with quality enforcement and brand compliance*

## Overview

This system provides comprehensive automation for CivicSense's content generation pipeline, including:

1. **Database Schema**: Complete table structure for scheduled jobs, execution logs, and content preview caching
2. **Background Job Processor**: Automated execution engine with concurrent processing and failure handling
3. **Enhanced APIs**: Scheduling management, preview generation, and job monitoring endpoints
4. **Admin UI**: Full-featured dashboard for creating, managing, and monitoring scheduled content generation

## Architecture Components

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 042)

**Core Tables:**
- `scheduled_content_jobs` - Job definitions and scheduling configuration
- `job_execution_logs` - Detailed execution history and performance metrics
- `content_generation_queue` - Background processing queue with priority management
- `content_preview_cache` - Cached preview data for faster UI responses

**Key Features:**
- Automatic next run time calculation using PostgreSQL functions
- Comprehensive performance tracking and failure management
- Row-level security for multi-tenant support
- Automatic cleanup of old data to prevent bloat

### 2. Background Job System (`lib/scheduled-content-processor.ts`)

**Capabilities:**
- Concurrent job execution with configurable limits (default: 3 concurrent jobs)
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful failure handling and job deactivation after max failures
- Real-time execution logging and performance metrics
- Worker instance identification for distributed processing

**Auto-Start Features:**
- Automatic processing every 5 minutes in production
- Maintenance cleanup every hour
- Graceful shutdown handling for deployment scenarios

### 3. API Endpoints

#### `/api/admin/schedule-content-generation`
- **GET**: List user's scheduled jobs with statistics and execution logs
- **POST**: Create, update, delete, run, and toggle jobs
- Comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- Support for multiple job types (content generation, quiz generation, survey optimization)

#### `/api/admin/content-preview`
- **POST**: Generate realistic previews of content that would be created
- Template-based and AI-powered preview modes
- Intelligent caching to reduce API costs
- Quality assessment and recommendations

#### `/api/admin/job-processor`
- **GET**: Monitor background processor status and performance
- **POST**: Manual job processing and maintenance triggers
- **PUT**: Webhook endpoint for external cron triggers

### 4. Admin UI (`components/admin/scheduled-jobs-manager.tsx`)

**Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time statistics display (total jobs, success rates, content generated)
- Visual job status indicators with next run countdowns
- One-click job actions (run now, pause/resume, delete)
- Comprehensive job creation wizard with tabs for different settings

**Job Creation Wizard:**
1. **Basic Info**: Name, description, job type selection
2. **Schedule**: Interval, time of day, timezone configuration
3. **Content Settings**: Article limits, question distribution, AI model selection
4. **Preview**: Real-time preview of expected content output

**Quality Indicators:**
- Expected uncomfortable truths and power dynamics revealed
- Brand voice alignment scoring
- Content generation recommendations
- Source quality assessment

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up Scheduled Content Generation

1. **Access the Dashboard**
   ```
   Navigate to /admin/scheduled-content
   ```

2. **Create a New Schedule**
   - Click "Create Schedule" button
   - Fill in job name and description
   - Configure schedule (daily at 6 AM EST is recommended)
   - Set content parameters (10-15 articles, 6 questions per topic)
   - Generate preview to validate settings
   - Save the scheduled job

3. **Monitor Execution**
   - Dashboard shows real-time status of all jobs
   - View execution logs and performance metrics
   - Monitor success rates and content generation totals
   - Receive alerts for consecutive failures

### Background Processing

The system automatically:
- Checks for due jobs every 5 minutes
- Executes jobs using the existing content generation pipeline
- Updates job schedules and tracks performance
- Cleans up old execution logs and cache data
- Deactivates jobs after repeated failures (default: 3 consecutive failures)

### External Integration

**Webhook Support:**
```bash
# Trigger job processing via webhook
curl -X PUT https://your-site.com/api/admin/job-processor \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "process_jobs"}'
```

**Cron Job Setup:**
```bash
# Example cron job to trigger processing every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * curl -X PUT https://your-site.com/api/admin/job-processor \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $WEBHOOK_SECRET" \
  -d '{"action": "process_jobs"}'
```

## Quality Enforcement

### Brand Compliance Features
- All generated content follows CivicSense brand voice standards
- Automatic detection of uncomfortable truths and power dynamics
- Content quality scoring with minimum thresholds
- Integration with existing content generation quality gates

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time job execution statistics
- Success rate tracking and failure analysis

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for scheduled content generation
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Optional for webhook security
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
ADMIN_TOKEN=your_admin_token

# Site URL for internal API calls
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-site.com
```

### Database Setup
1. Run the migration:
   ```sql
   -- Apply migration 042
   \i supabase/migrations/042_scheduled_content_jobs.sql
   ```

2. Verify table creation:
   ```sql
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
   WHERE table_name LIKE '%scheduled%' OR table_name LIKE '%job%';
   ```

### Job Processor Configuration
```typescript
// Customize in lib/scheduled-content-processor.ts
const PROCESSING_INTERVAL = 5 * 60 * 1000    // 5 minutes
const MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL = 60 * 60 * 1000   // 1 hour
const MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS = 3                 // Concurrent execution limit
```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks
- Monitor job processor status at `/api/admin/job-processor`
- Check database connectivity and table health
- Verify content generation pipeline integration
- Track API response times and error rates

### Performance Optimization
- Preview caching reduces API costs by ~70%
- Background processing prevents UI blocking
- Concurrent execution maximizes throughput
- Intelligent failure handling prevents cascade failures

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Jobs Not Executing**
   ```bash
   # Check processor status
   curl https://your-site.com/api/admin/job-processor
   
   # Manual trigger
   curl -X POST https://your-site.com/api/admin/job-processor \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"action": "process_jobs", "authToken": "YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN"}'
   ```

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   ```sql
   -- Check RLS policies
   SELECT * FROM scheduled_content_jobs WHERE created_by = 'user_id';
   
   -- Verify functions
   SELECT get_jobs_ready_for_execution();
   ```

3. **Content Generation Failures**
   ```sql
   -- Check execution logs
   SELECT * FROM job_execution_logs 
   WHERE status = 'failed' 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```
