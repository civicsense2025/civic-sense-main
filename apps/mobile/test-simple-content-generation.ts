            "Justice Samuel Alito",

            "Justice Amy Coney Barrett"
          ],
          correct_answer: "Justice Clarence Thomas",
          explanation: "Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin's December 2024 report documented that Justice Clarence Thomas received approximately $4 million in luxury travel, vacations, and gifts from billionaire Republican donor Harlan Crow and others over two decades, most undisclosed until ProPublica investigations forced disclosure. This violates federal disclosure laws that require justices to report gifts over $415. Thomas argued these were 'hospitality from close personal friends' - but ethics experts note that when friends are billionaires with cases before the Court, 'friendship' becomes a fig leaf for influence.",
