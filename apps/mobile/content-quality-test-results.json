          "A) Mandatory annual financial disclosure reviews",
          "B) New recusal guidelines for cases involving family members",

        "explanation": "Chief Justice Roberts announced in February 2025 that justices would need to report gifts more comprehensively, following criticism about Justice Thomas's unreported luxury trips. This matters because it directly affects how much citizens know about potential conflicts of interest in the highest court.",
