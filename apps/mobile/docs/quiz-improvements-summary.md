# Quiz Improvements Summary

## ✅ **Major Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Double Loading Issue Resolution**
**Problem**: Quiz was loading twice causing conflicts and infinite loading states
**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive loading state management
- ✅ Stabilized search parameters with proper dependency arrays
- ✅ Added ref-based initialization tracking to prevent race conditions
- ✅ Enhanced loading guards with multiple validation checks
- ✅ Added quiz ID change detection for proper resets
- ✅ Simplified dependency arrays to prevent circular dependencies

**Result**: Clean single load per quiz session with proper state management

### 2. **Answer Recording Service Enhancement**
**Problem**: `QuestionResponseService` was failing with "Failed to update question memory" error
**Solution**: Made the service more resilient and graceful
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for missing database tables
- ✅ Implemented graceful degradation when spaced repetition tables don't exist
- ✅ Changed from throwing errors to logging warnings for non-critical failures
- ✅ Added partial success handling - quiz continues even if some tracking fails
- ✅ Used `maybeSingle()` instead of `single()` to handle missing records

**Result**: Answer recording now works reliably without blocking quiz flow
