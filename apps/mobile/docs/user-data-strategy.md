## 1  Guiding Principles
1. **Truth Over Comfort** â€” collect only data that makes users harder to manipulate.  
2. **Action Over Passive Consumption** â€” every stored field must map to a concrete next-step we can show the user (quiz reminder, skill plan, etc.).  
3. **Accessibility Is Democracy** â€” store user preferences (font size, reduced motion) so we never break their experience.  
4. **Transparency by Default** â€” surface *all* tracked data in a "My Civic Data" dashboard (opt-out or delete at any time).  
5. **No Dark Patterns** â€” never record or infer sensitive traits (political affiliation, health, religion) without explicit need and consent.

## 2  Data Governance & Privacy
| Area | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Consent** | First session â†’ granular toggles (analytics, personalised tips, email). |
| **Retention** | Default 3 years, auto-anonymise inactive accounts after 18 months. |
| **RLS** | All `user_*` tables: `user_id = auth.uid()`.  Admin role can `select`, never `update/delete` directly. |
| **Auditing** | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by` on every row. |
| **Encryption** | PII fields (`email`, `phone`) â†’ column level pgcrypto.  Tokens â†’ `expo-secure-store`. |

> See `supabase/policies/` for exact SQL.

## 3  Table-by-Table Playbook

### 3.1  Learning Progress
| Table | Purpose | When to Write | Key Columns |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `user_progress` | Current position in any multi-step flow (quiz, lesson) | On every step change | `content_id`, `step_index`, `time_spent_ms` |

## 6  Open Questions & Next Steps
1. **GDPR / CCPA portal** â€” build export & delete flows.  
2. **Data volume** â€” estimate row growth (esp. `user_question_responses`, `question_analytics`). Partitioning strategy?  
3. **Realtime triggers** â€” use Supabase Functions for live streak counters and multiplayer notifications?  
4. **Cross-device sync** â€” reconcile progress when offline edits collide.  
5. **Public API** â€” allow users to export their learning data to personal data pods.
6. **Question quality pipeline** â€” automate flagging of low-clarity questions based on `question_feedback_stats`.
7. **Content generation ethics** â€” ensure AI-generated questions in `content_generation_queue` maintain CivicSense's "uncomfortable truths" standard.
8. **Multiplayer privacy** â€” what question response data do we share between users in `multiplayer_question_responses`?
9. **NPC training** â€” how do we train AI personas in `npc_question_responses` to embody historical civic leaders authentically?
10. **Spaced repetition optimization** â€” tune algorithms using `user_question_memory` to maximize long-term civic knowledge retention.

> **Action Item**: schedule a data-model review with curriculum + infra teams before enabling writes to these tables.

### Priority Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1**: Core question tracking (`user_question_responses`, `question_analytics`)
2. **Phase 2**: Spaced repetition system (`user_question_memory`, adaptive quizzing)
3. **Phase 3**: Content quality feedback loop (`question_feedback`, `question_feedback_stats`)
4. **Phase 4**: Social features (`multiplayer_question_responses`, `friend_requests`)
5. **Phase 5**: Advanced AI features (`npc_question_responses`, `content_generation_queue`)

**Remember**: Every insert or update should answer the question *"How does this empower the user to engage with power structures?"*  If it doesn't, it doesn't belong in our database.
