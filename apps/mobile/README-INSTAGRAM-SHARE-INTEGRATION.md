## Usage Examples

### Basic Topic Sharing
```typescript
import { InstagramStoryShareV2 } from '@/components/ui/InstagramStoryShareV2';

<InstagramStoryShareV2
  type="topic"
  topic={{
    id: 'constitutional-rights',
    title: 'Constitutional Rights',
    description: 'Understanding your fundamental protections',
    emoji: '🏛️',
    category: 'Government',
    difficulty: 'medium',
  }}
  userName="John Doe"
  userId={user?.id}
  onShareComplete={(result) => {
    if (result.success) {
      Alert.alert('Shared!', 'Topic shared to Instagram Story');
    }
  }}
  onError={(error) => {
    Alert.alert('Error', error);
  }}
/>
```

### Streak Sharing (Integrated in Home Screen)
```typescript
// This is automatically handled in the daily progress card
// When users tap the share button next to their streak:

<DailyProgressCard
  onStart={handleDailyChallenge}
  selectedDate={date}
  dailyChallenge={dailyChallenge}
  streakStats={streakStats}
  onShare={() => handleShareTopic(
    {
      id: 'daily-streak',
      topic_id: 'daily-streak',
      title: `${streakStats.currentStreak}-Day Streak`,
      topic_title: `${streakStats.currentStreak}-Day Learning Streak`,
      description: `I've maintained a ${streakStats.currentStreak}-day learning streak on CivicSense!`,
      emoji: '🔥',
      isFeatured: false,
      isBreaking: false,
    },
    'streak'
  )}
/>
```

### Quiz Results Sharing
```typescript
<InstagramStoryShareV2
  type="result"
  topic={completedTopic}
  userProgress={{
    score: 85,
    totalQuestions: 10,
    streak: currentStreak,
    completedAt: new Date(),
  }}
  userName={profile?.full_name}
  userId={user?.id}
/>
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Image Generation Flow
1. User taps share button
2. Component determines share type and builds parameters
3. Calls appropriate generator function (`generateInstagramStory`, etc.)
4. Function makes API request to `/api/generate-image`
5. Server generates SVG with dynamic content
6. Client downloads and caches image
7. Native share functionality presents options

### 2. Platform-Specific Features

#### iOS
- Uses `expo-sharing` for native share sheet
- `expo-media-library` for saving to Photos
- Permission handling for photo library access

#### Android
- Uses `expo-sharing` for share intents
- `expo-media-library` with Android permissions
- Handles storage scoped permissions

### 3. Error Handling
- Network failures gracefully handled with retry options
- Permission denials show helpful explanations
- Image generation failures fall back to text sharing
- User-friendly error messages throughout

### 4. Analytics Tracking
- Share completion rates by type
- Platform distribution (Instagram vs. other)
- Topic popularity through shares
- User engagement patterns

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Daily challenge card shows share button for 3+ day streaks
- [ ] Topic cards have functional share buttons
- [ ] Generated images match expected design
- [ ] Share functionality works on both iOS and Android
- [ ] Permissions are requested appropriately
- [ ] Error states display helpful messages
- [ ] Analytics events fire correctly

### Test Page
Use the test page at `apps/mobile/app/test-story-share.tsx` to:
- Preview all share types
- Test different data scenarios
- Verify image generation
- Debug sharing flow issues

## Performance Considerations

- **Image Caching**: Generated images cached locally to prevent re-downloads
- **Lazy Loading**: Share component only renders when modal is opened
- **Network Optimization**: Compressed SVG generation for faster downloads
- **Memory Management**: Images disposed after sharing to prevent memory leaks

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Custom background themes for shares
- [ ] Multiple image formats (square, landscape)
- [ ] Video story generation for major achievements
- [ ] Template customization by users
- [ ] Social proof elements (community size, etc.)

### Metrics to Track
- Share-to-registration conversion rates
- Viral coefficient from shared content
- Topic engagement increase from shares
- User retention impact of sharing features
