# 🏫 Google Classroom → Learning Pod Integration

**Complete system for transforming Google Classroom courses into collaborative CivicSense learning pods with automatic roster sync, student invitations, and seamless integration.**

## 🎯 Overview

This integration allows educators to:
- Import Google Classroom courses as learning pods
- Automatically sync student rosters with names, emails, and profiles
- Send personalized invitation emails to all students
- Maintain ongoing synchronization between platforms
- Track quiz results and sync grades back to Google Classroom

## ✅ Current Status

### ✅ **WORKING COMPONENTS**
- **Google Classroom API Connection**: ✅ Fully operational
- **OAuth Authentication Flow**: ✅ Working with test tokens
- **Course Import System**: ✅ Complete UI component built
- **Roster Sync**: ✅ API endpoints implemented
- **Email Invitations**: ✅ System ready (simulated email sending)
- **Pod Management**: ✅ Integrated with existing learning pod system

### 🔧 **READY FOR PRODUCTION**
- **API Authentication**: Using test tokens - needs production OAuth credentials

```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. **Test the Integration**
Visit `/test-classroom-setup` to verify your Google Classroom API connection is working.

### 2. **Create Pod from Classroom**
Visit `/create-pod-from-classroom` to use the full integration workflow:
1. Select a Google Classroom course
2. Configure pod settings
3. Review and create the pod
4. Import student roster
5. Send invitation emails

### 3. **Access from Learning Pods**
The main `/learning-pods` page now includes a prominent callout for the Google Classroom integration.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Course Import Workflow
```typescript
// 1. Fetch user's Google Classroom courses
const courses = await fetch('/api/integrations/classroom/courses')

// 2. Select course and load roster
const roster = await fetch(`/api/integrations/classroom/courses/${courseId}/roster`)

// 3. Create learning pod with Classroom metadata
const pod = await fetch('/api/learning-pods', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    podName: courseName,
    podType: 'classroom',
    classroomCourseId: courseId,
    classroomCourseName: courseName
  })
})

// 4. Import roster and create user accounts
const rosterImport = await fetch(`/api/learning-pods/${podId}/import-roster`, {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ courseId, students })
})

// 5. Send invitation emails
const invites = await fetch(`/api/learning-pods/${podId}/send-invites`, {
  method: 'POST', 
  body: JSON.stringify({ students, courseName })
})
```

### Database Integration
The system integrates with existing learning pod tables and adds:
```sql
-- Enhanced learning_pods table
ALTER TABLE learning_pods ADD COLUMN classroom_course_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE learning_pods ADD COLUMN classroom_integration_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE learning_pods ADD COLUMN roster_last_synced TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- New tables for pending users and invites
CREATE TABLE pending_users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  full_name TEXT,
  google_id TEXT,
  invite_source TEXT,
  requires_parent_consent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
);

CREATE TABLE pod_invites (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  pod_id UUID REFERENCES learning_pods(id),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  invite_type TEXT,
  classroom_course_id TEXT,
  sent_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
