-- FIX MULTIPLAYER RLS POLICIES - RESOLVE 406/401 ERRORS
-- =============================================================================
-- This migration fixes overly restrictive RLS policies that are preventing
-- users from viewing other players in multiplayer rooms and causing:
-- - 406 (Not Acceptable) errors when querying multiplayer_room_players
-- - 401 (Unauthorized) errors when inserting into multiplayer_room_players
-- - "new row violates row-level security policy" errors
--
-- Root Cause: The policies created in migration 054 were too restrictive,
-- only allowing users to see their own records instead of allowing players
-- to see other players in the same room.
--
-- SAFETY: This migration is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely

-- =============================================================================
-- MIGRATION SUMMARY
-- =============================================================================
-- ‚úÖ Dropped overly restrictive RLS policies on multiplayer_room_players
-- ‚úÖ Created new policies that allow players to see other players in same room
-- ‚úÖ Fixed 406/401 errors when viewing/joining multiplayer rooms
-- ‚úÖ Maintained security by ensuring users can only modify their own records
-- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive testing to validate policy functionality
-- ‚úÖ Preserved service_role access for admin functions
--
-- The key insight: Multiplayer games require players to see OTHER players
-- in the same room, not just their own records. The previous policies were
-- too restrictive and broke basic multiplayer functionality.
